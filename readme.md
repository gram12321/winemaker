# Winery Management Game Version 0.3

A web-based simulation game where players manage their own winery, from vineyard operations to wine production and sales.
This is a new iteration of the 0.25 build

Look in @readme_old.md for the old readme describing the entire content of the game. 

Changes from 0.25
 - Introduces React, typescript and tailwind
 - We are still running SPA but we use react Views instead of overlays. No more Bootstrap
 - Mail layout is now a topbar, not a sidebar, no panel, no permanent console
 - We still have the @console but now we use toast UI and have a permanent message history
