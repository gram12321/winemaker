Known Bugs:
-Save load Owned land and staff (Safe to firestore, but dont restore from localstorage)
Allow winery-task on same field,grape,vintage if different entry (IE different quality)
Possible a bug in AmountWork. That calculates workforce of staff without taking care if workers split their workforce to several task
Bookeeping task dosn't update "Goal", when more task is added to unfinished task (It does, but does not update UI, so need page refresh to show rightly)
Make sure to clean localstorage on login, in case game was closed without clearing
Fermenting task has correct value in workprogress, but dont update "Progress" on taskbox info
Wineorders not saved to firestore, just to localstorage
last order in wineordertable causes [15:00:29] Invalid wine order index. Can refresh page to make right 
Possible a crash if 0.000something is left in a task (IE 0.00004 must left will leave fermantation task open, but not possible to finih)
Close by clicking X on hirering overlay dont work
There might be an issue where annualYieldFactor  is producing values below 0.5 which is not intentinally. 
Plant buttom is not disabled when active clearing task, but we dont allow planting task when active clearing task
Imidiatly on building a building the headline (name of the building) disapears. reshows on pageupdate
Buildingname only shows in taskbox after pagereload
in buildings.html build buttom change to "Building..." when a building proces is started. But it resets to "Build" on page reload
Prevent several building and maintaince task on same building
There dosnøt seems to be a prestige hit for not completing bookkeeeping task as intented





QoL Improvement
 - Hover over info on "Statuspic" on sales.html
 - Default selected staff for new task
  - group orders by field, grape ect. or somekind of filter on orders
  group similiar entries in cashflow
  hover over info on icons. IE (Status icon, wineordertype icon ect. )
  Planting expense needs a consolemsg
  Clicking field name in Vineyard should open the farmlandoverlay
  Clicking staff name in Select staff overlay should open staffoverlay
  add error consolemsg when clicking a building that is not build
  add error when trying to build a building that allreadu excist
  Better info on Maintaince task - like what building is maintained and is it building or upgrading. 
  

 New/Better mechanics
  - Let quantity of generateWineOrder() be depending on a asking price. Asking price could be set in sales.html instead of the Normal selling buttom
  add cost, adminstrationtask and msg for building buildings and tools
   - Ability to choose witch worker uses what tool. Show which staff is using tools in stafdisplay/consolemsg
   Expected yield (in vineyard.html (displayvineywarentried in vineyard.js)) should give a string to the user instead of a value (IE "High/Great/poor" instead of "0.9")
