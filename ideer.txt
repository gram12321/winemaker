Known Bugs:
-Save load Owned land and staff (Safe to firestore, but dont restore from localstorage)
Allow winery-task on same field,grape,vintage if different entry (IE different quality)
Possible a bug in AmountWork. That calculates workforce of staff without taking care if workers split their workforce to several task
Bookeeping task dosn't update "Goal", when more task is added to unfinished task (It does, but does not update UI, so need page refresh to show rightly)
Make sure to clean localstorage on login, in case game was closed without clearing
Fermenting task has correct value in workprogress, but dont update "Progress" on taskbox info
Wineorders not saved to firestore, just to localstorage
last order in wineordertable causes [15:00:29] Invalid wine order index. Can refresh page to make right 
Possible a crash if 0.000something is left in a task (IE 0.00004 must left will leave fermantation task open, but not possible to finih)
Close by clicking X on hirering overlay dont work
There might be an issue where annualYieldFactor  is producing values below 0.5 which is not intentinally. 
Plant buttom is not disabled when active clearing task, but we dont allow planting task when active clearing task
Imidiatly on building a building the headline (name of the building) disapears. reshows on pageupdate
Buildingname only shows in taskbox after pagereload
in buildings.html build buttom change to "Building..." when a building proces is started. But it resets to "Build" on page reload
Prevent several building and maintaince task on same building
There dosnøt seems to be a prestige hit for not completing bookkeeeping task as intented

Fixed becuase of 0.02 patch
 - Fix cost for buildbuildings og upgradebuildings (None is applyed as of now)



QoL Improvement
 - Hover over info on "Statuspic" on sales.html
 - Default selected staff for new task
  - group orders by field, grape ect. or somekind of filter on orders
  group similiar entries in cashflow
  hover over info on icons. IE (Status icon, wineordertype icon ect. )
  Planting expense needs a consolemsg
  Clicking field name in Vineyard should open the farmlandoverlay
  Clicking staff name in Select staff overlay should open staffoverlay
  add error consolemsg when clicking a building that is not build
  add error when trying to build a building that allreadu excist
  Better info on Maintaince task - like what building is maintained and is it building or upgrading. 
  

 New/Better mechanics
  - Let quantity of generateWineOrder() be depending on a asking price. Asking price could be set in sales.html instead of the Normal selling buttom
  add cost, adminstrationtask and msg for building buildings and tools
   - Ability to choose witch worker uses what tool. Show which staff is using tools in stafdisplay/consolemsg
   Expected yield (in vineyard.html (displayvineywarentried in vineyard.js)) should give a string to the user instead of a value (IE "High/Great/poor" instead of "0.9") 
   No Upgradecost applied to upgrade building even if there is a function for it (that is not used)



Usefull wine knowledge:

600 liters of Must per ton of Grapes

In general terms, 1 ton of grapes produces approximately:
   - 60 cases of wine, which translates to about 720 bottles
     (assuming 12 bottles per case).

Breakdown:
   - 1 ton of grapes ≈ 60 cases of wine
   - 1 case of wine = 12 bottles
   - 1 ton of grapes ≈ 720 bottles

Yield Categories:

   1. Low Yield (Quality-focused, Old World and Cool Climate):
      - Around 2-4 tons per acre.
      - Common in high-quality, low-yielding regions like Burgundy 
        or certain parts of Napa Valley.

   2. Moderate Yield (Balanced Quality and Quantity):
      - Around 4-6 tons per acre.
      - Many vineyards in moderate climates and quality-focused 
        New World regions fall within this range.

   3. High Yield (High-production or Bulk Wines):
      - Around 6-10+ tons per acre.
      - Often found in warmer regions with fertile soil, where
        the focus may be on quantity rather than premium quality 
        (e.g., La Mancha in Spain, Central Valley in California).


High-Density, Well-Pruned Vineyards:
Lower per-vine yield but better fruit concentration due to competition and careful trimming.
These vineyards typically yield 3-6 tons per hectare, with intense, complex wines.
Low-Density, Less-Pruned Vineyards:
Higher yields per vine but potentially diluted fruit flavors. Yields can reach 10-15+ tons per hectare, but the wine might be less complex.
Moderate-Density, Balanced Pruning:
Moderate yields (5-10 tons per hectare) and good quality, common in vineyards aiming for a balance of quality and quantity.

Typical Vineyard Yields:

High-Yield Vineyards: 10-15 tons per hectare (4-6 tons per acre).
These vineyards prioritize quantity, often using fertile soils, irrigation, and lower-cost grape varieties.
Moderate-Yield Vineyards: 5-10 tons per hectare (2-4 tons per acre).
This range is typical for well-managed vineyards that balance quality with profitability. The resulting wine is generally good but not as concentrated as that from low-yield vineyards.
Low-Yield Vineyards: 2-5 tons per hectare (0.8-2 tons per acre).
These vineyards focus on quality, often found in prestigious wine regions where vine stress (from poor soil, limited water, etc.) leads to more concentrated, complex wines.
Very Low-Yield Vineyards: 1-2 tons per hectare (0.4-0.8 tons per acre).
Found in premium vineyards with very old vines or those grown in particularly challenging conditions. The yield is small, but the wine produced is highly sought after for its intense flavors and depth.
Influencing Factors:

Soil:
Fertile soils can increase yields to 15+ tons per hectare, but often at the cost of flavor intensity.
Poor, well-drained soils typically limit yields to 3-7 tons per hectare, enhancing quality.
Climate:
Warmer, irrigated regions like California’s Central Valley can reach 10-15 tons per hectare.
Cooler or drier regions like Burgundy or parts of Spain may yield 3-6 tons per hectare due to limited water and slower growth.
Age of Vines:
Young Vines (under 10 years): Can yield 8-12 tons per hectare but might produce simpler wines.
Mature Vines (10-30 years): Typically yield 5-10 tons per hectare, often resulting in balanced wines.
Old Vines (over 30 years): Yields drop significantly, often below 5 tons per hectare, with some premium wines coming from vines that yield as little as 1-3 tons per hectare.

We uses Json and localstorage several places in endday.js This should not be nessesart as we are a SPA and all storage between session is in adminfunctions. We allready have some function in place in adminfunctions for maniplulating farmland.

Lets try to eliminate JSON and localstorage in endday, prefeably using excisting function in aminfunctions or creating new to handle storing between sessions
